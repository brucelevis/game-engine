Asset Tracker
- handle tracker file errors, broken
- tracker keeps adding to tracker file
- pak files/ get asset by pak file offset
- get the entire asset system off strings, only the entry point of importing should be strings(or in editor asset importing)
- figure out how to handle LOD
		
FBX
- fbx hardcoded asset name
- make sure uvs,textures, normals are properly imported
- update in game mesh when fbx file updates (sync when edits)
- import materials, textures, lights, all the other objects
- multipolygon to triangles 4+ sided meshes
- multi thread imports of assets

Material System
- material id	
- Triangle list<first index, num index, material_index> for multiple materials per mesh
- Material layering?
- pbr workflow / material system

Debug (More in game debug tools)
- Normals, tangents, bitangents visualzation
- memory stats / allocator stats. How much has been allocated, freed, how many allocs, etc
- debug windows/overlays
- Hot loading


System Desgin
- String interning/ string management
- multi threaded game loop
- write non platform specific file handling utils
- general purpose allocator
- pool allocator
- Simd/ Optimize / Profile/ Vtune


Rendering
- Vulkan backend?
- Directx backend? If we have vulkan, we probably dont need dx12
- gamma corrected lighting
- implement deffered rendering
- more lights/ point light / cone lighting
- frustum culling
- occlusion culling
